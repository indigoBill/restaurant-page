# Restaurant Page

## Project Description

This is a website for a fictional Jamaican Restaurant called 'Island Flavor'. The site contains a home, menu and contact page. Users are able to move from page to page by clicking on the different page tabs or by pressing the TAB button on their keyboards.

This project was made to get a better understanding of ES6 Modules and the module bundler Webpack. The languages used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was also able to experiment with installing packages through the npm and using npm scripts to automate tasks that I previously handled manually in older projects.

One of the biggest challenges I faced during this project was going from a small project folder that contained at most four different files to a project folder that had several subfolders with several different files. Although the benefits of splitting code into different modules was very apparent during my time working on this project, it took a while for me to get used to navigating through several different JavaScript and CSS files.
